Heard you met some guy
Only been a few weeks
How can you be fine?
God, you make it look so easy
While I'm still caught up on you leavin'
Does he treat you right?
Does he treat you different?
I've been losin' nights
Somewhere between the high and lonely
Wonderin' if you think about me
'Cause I'm always thinking 'bout you
Are you falling in love
While I've been falling to pieces?
All these memories of us
Wish that I had amnesia
To forget that you left
'Cause you'rе still in my head
I always bottle it up
Until the bottlе is empty
I'm still drunk in your love
Reading notes that you left me
All the good times I'd lose
To erase you, oh, I'd do anything
Mornings in New York
Left your coffee cup there
Sittin' on the floor
This apartment's like my head
So messy
I'll throw you away when I'm ready
'Cause I'm still not over you
Are you fallin' in love
While I've been falling to pieces?
All these memories of us
Wish I had that amnesia
To forget that you left
'Cause you're still in my head
I always bottle it up
Until the bottle is empty
I'm still drunk in your love
Reading notes that you left me
All the good times I'd lose
To erase you, oh, I'd do anything
Oh, oh, I'd do anything
Oh, oh
Heard you met some guy
Only been a few weeks
How could you be fine?
God, you make it look so easy
So easy, oh-oh
Are you fallin' in love
While I've been fallin' to pieces?
All these memories of us
Wish that I had amnesia
To forget that you left
'Cause you're still in my head
I always bottle it up
Until the bottle is empty
I'm still drunk on your love
Readin' notes that you left me
All the good times I'd lose
To erase you, oh, I'd do anything
