Tell me what you need and I will find a way to stop the bleeding
No, dont add to my mistakes.
Tell me youre not leaving and Ill tell you everything you need to know.
Dont throw it all away, dont say my words are just too late.

I dont want to be left behind, Ive been so blind to all that I have broken.
Can we put this back together?
No more empty promises, they dont exist just me out in the open.
I know this will take time, can you give me one last chance to make it right?

You say the storys ending but I think its time we stop pretending
No, cant let you turn the page.
Does your heart remember when we used to say forever, dont let go.
Dont throw it all away dont say these words are just too late.

I dont want to be left behind, Ive been so blind to all that I have broken.
Can we put this back together?
No more empty promises, they dont exist just me out in the open.
I know this will take time, can we put the past behind us,
Tonight Im gonna fight for you just give me one last chance to make it right,
Last chance to make it right.

I dont want to be left behind, Ive been so blind to all that I have broken.
Can we put this back together?
No more empty promises, they dont exist just me out in the open.
I know this will take time, can you give me one last chance to make it right?

Give me one last chance to make it right,
A last chance to make it right
A last chance to make it right
No more empty promises, they dont exist just me out in the open.
I know this will take time, can you give me one last chance to make it right?
