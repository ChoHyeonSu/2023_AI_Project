Oh it's been
6 months, 12 hours since you went away
미련하게 세고 있던것도 나인데
Why you gotta tell me baby when you're far away

뛰어다녀 every morning in my 마음속에
친구들이 제발 나보고 그만하래
Trust me 나도 제발 그만하고싶은데
이게 마음대로만은 안돼

★ Verse 1: Hanuel ★
I want you to stay, but if you wanna go it's okay
I'll live with the fact that you’re gone from me
Cause I’ve been writing down and singing songs about
How my life's been going round and round
Been alright but to see you smile (I don't know what to do anymore)

So just tell me to stay, won't go hesitate for you
I'll go anywhere, I'll come anywhere you want
Do I know what you'll say, my feelings at bay
Cause I'll be okay, don't you worry bout me

★ Pre-Hook: Hanuel ★
So maybe we'll be more than friends
I know I don't want this to end
We'll call it our flowers in may
I'll show you my best everything

★ Hook: Hanuel & Keris ★
You give me butterflies and I
I can’t get you out of my mind
So tell me darling
내마음은 이런데 너는 어떤지
Was I easy, am I blind?
You know I will never leave your side
So tell me
Am I crazy for you?

★ Verse 2: HNATA ★
Two sides, same coin got me going bright eyed
Just one thought of you has got me feeling so alive
Tell me why
Light it up like the 4th of July
I’m losing pace, but I’m still tryna stay professional
I hope you see the way I am by being passionate, yeah
But the same song keeps playing again and again

★ Hook: Hanuel & Keris ★
You give me butterflies and I
I can’t get you out of my mind
So tell me darling
내마음은 이런데 너는 어떤지
Was I easy, am I blind?
You know I will never leave your side
So tell me
Am I crazy for you?
