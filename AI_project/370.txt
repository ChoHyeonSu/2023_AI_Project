When I was a boy
I thought it just came to you
But I never could tell what's mine
So it didn't matter anyway
My only pride and joy
Was this racket down here
Bangin' on an old guitar
And singin' what I had to say
I always thought our house was haunted
'Cause nobody said "boo" to me
I never did get what I wanted
But now I get what I need
It's been a slow turnin'
From the inside out
A slow turnin', baby
But you come about
A slow learnin'
But you learn to sway
A slow turnin', baby
Not fade away, not fade away, not fade away
Now I'm in my car
Ooh, I got the radio down
Now I'm yellin' at the kids in the back
'Cause they're bangin' like Charlie Watts
You think you've come so far
In this one horse town
Then she's laughin' that crazy laugh
'Cause you haven't left the parking lot
Time is short and here's the damn thing about it
You're gonna die, gonna die for sure
And you can learn to live with love or without it
But there ain't no cure
It's just a slow turnin'
From the inside out
A slow turnin'
But you come about, ya
A slow learnin', baby
But you learn to sway
A slow turnin'
Not fade away, not fade away, not fade away
Not fade away, not fade away
A slow turnin'
A slow turnin'
A slow turnin'
A slow turnin'
