I'm caught here in this vacuum
I'm fallen from a sunless sky
I’ll rid myself of value
And leave this emptiness behind

So I run, before it's over
I run but still never leave it seems
I run, but not getting closer
I run, to get away from this dream

I've been watching you from a distance
I've been monitoring you from cloudless skies
I've been calling your name just to ease your resistance
But nothing seems to shift your darkened sky

I run, before it's over
I run but still never leave it seems
I run, but not getting closer
I run, to get away from this dream

I'm in orbit, stars exploding
When I call your name
Here’s too dark and lonely
You're my compass
The only reason to stay.....
 run, before it's over
I run but still never leave it seems
I run, but not getting closer
And I run, to get away from this dream

I run, but not getting closer
I run, but still I believe, it seems
