Here I am Running round in circles Facing this again Saying things Like I’m truly sorry Ain’t no good revenge I thought we were getting somewhere, lately I see that you don’t seem to care Let me draw it out for you It never ends, running in circles Never ends, circles Now I’m lost and I’m searching for you baby I wish I kept an eye On you closer I thought we were getting somewhere, lately I see that you don’t seem to care, anymore It never ends, running in circles Never ends, circles It never ends, running in circles Never ends, circles'
