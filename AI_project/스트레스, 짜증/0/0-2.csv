"Here I am Running round in circles Facing this again Saying things Like I’m truly sorry Ain’t no good revenge"; 3
"I thought we were getting somewhere, lately I see that you don’t seem to care Let me draw it out for you"; 3, 5
"It never ends, running in circles Never ends, circles Now I’m lost and I’m searching for you baby"; 4, 5
"I wish I kept an eye On you closer I thought we were getting somewhere, lately I see that you don’t seem to care, anymore"; 3, 4, 5
"It never ends, running in circles Never ends, circles It never ends, running in circles Never ends, circles"; 3, 4
