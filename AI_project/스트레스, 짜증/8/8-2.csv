"Dream another nightmare I'm in love with all these ghosts Stumble up a flight of stairs Wake up all alone"; 4, 5
"Mixin' up my words now Don't leave me high and dry 'Cause I'm mixin' up prescriptions I don't wanna lose my life"; 3, 5
"I'm afraid that misery Might take me backwards I'm afraid my misery Might bring you down"; 5
"It's 'cause I don't love me anymore I kill myself every day a little more And I need you now like I needed you then"; 5
"I don't love me so I can't love you in the end I don't love you anymore I lose myself every day a little more"; 5
"And I don't need you now Like I needed you then I don't love me so I can't love you in the end"; 5
"I wish that I was someone else Different face and different home 'Cause I'm cleanin' out my closet Afraid of what I'll find alone"; 4, 5
"Now I'm tryin' to remember What it felt like to hold you You said 'why you let yourself down?' 'Why do these demons control you?'"; 5
"I'm afraid that misery Might take me backwards I'm afraid my misery might bring you down"; 5
"It's 'cause I don't love me anymore I kill myself every day a little more And I need you now like I needed you then"; 5
"I don't love me so I can't love you in the end I don't love you anymore I lose myself every day a little more"; 5
"And I don't need you now Like I needed you then I don't love me so I can't love you in the end In the end In the end"; 5
"I don't really love you I can't even hug you I don't love me I can't love you"; 5
