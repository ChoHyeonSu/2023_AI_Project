Dream another nightmare I'm in love with all these ghosts Stumble up a flight of stairs Wake up all alone Mixin' up my words now Don't leave me high and dry 'Cause I'm mixin' up prescriptions I don't wanna lose my life I'm afraid that misery Might take me backwards I'm afraid my misery Might bring you down It's 'cause I don't love me anymore I kill myself every day a little more And I need you now like I needed you then I don't love me so I can't love you in the end I don't love you anymore I lose myself every day a little more And I don't need you now Like I needed you then I don't love me so I can't love you in the end I wish that I was someone else Different face and different home 'Cause I'm cleanin' out my closet Afraid of what I'll find alone Now I'm tryin' to remember What it felt like to hold you You said 'why you let yourself down?' 'Why do these demons control you?' I'm afraid that misery Might take me backwards I'm afraid my misery might bring you down It's 'cause I don't love me anymore I kill myself every day a little more And I need you now like I needed you then I don't love me so I can't love you in the end I don't love you anymore I lose myself every day a little more And I don't need you now Like I needed you then I don't love me so I can't love you in the end In the end In the end I don't really love you I can't even hug you I don't love me I can't love you"
