"They say there's no such thing as a bad trip But if there's no such thing Then tell me what the hell just happened 'Cause it was worse than I imagined Two tabs only 7 hours later I cried and I screamed You were laying next to me But you didn't cry 'Cause you already cried Through that whole night yeah I just wanna die sometimes Don't let me die in the dark Don't let me die in the dark Don't let me die in the dark Don't let me lose my mind 'Cause it's falling apart Yeah it's falling apart yeah it's falling apart It was a real bad night Don't let me die in the dark Don't let me die in the dark Don't let me die in the dark Don't let me lose my mind 'Cause it's falling apart Yeah it's falling apart yeah it's falling apart Thought that I was God guess not 'Cause I woke up feeling like shit Got the whole thing wrong Should have seen it all along Felt my ego die but I guess it's too strong I cried and I screamed You were laying next to me But you didn't cry 'Cause you already cried Through that whole night yeah I just wanna die sometimes Don't let me die in the dark Don't let me die in the dark Don't let me die in the dark Don't let me lose my mind 'Cause it's falling apart Yeah it's falling apart yeah it's falling apart It was a real bad night Don't let me die in the dark Don't let me die in the dark Don't let me die in the dark Don't let me lose my mind 'Cause it's falling apart Yeah it's falling apart yeah It's falling apart ohh ohh Don't let me die in the dark Don't let me die in the dark Don't let me die in the dark Don't let me lose my mind 'Cause it's falling apart Yeah it's falling apart yeah it's falling apart It was a real bad night'
