Where do you go when you sleep?
When you're falling through a dream
Things aren't always what they seem
I could fall in to this deceit
A hundred times
Guess that's good enough for me
I am all in
Hang this feeling out to dry
Love me til you choke
(Love, love)
(Love)
Love me til you choke (love)
(Love, love)
Love me- (Love)
Love me til you- (Until you choke)
Choke
Love me- (love)
Love me 'til you choke (love)
