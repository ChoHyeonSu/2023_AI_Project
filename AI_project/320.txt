Sunny
Yesterday my life
was filled with rain
Sunny
You smiled at me
And really eased the pain
The dark days are gone
And the bright days are here
My Sunny one shines so sincere
Sunny
One so true I love you
Sunny
Thank you for the sunshine bouquet
Sunny
Thank you for the love
you brought my way
You gave to me
your all and all
Now I feel ten feet tall
Sunny
One so true I love you
Sunny
Thank you for the truth
you let me see
Sunny
Thank you for the facts
from A to Z
My life was torn like
a windblown sand
And the rock was formed
when you held my hand
Sunny
One so true I love you
Sunny
Sunny
Thank you for the smile
upon your face
Sunny
Thank you for the gleam
that shows its grace
You're my spark of nature's fire
You're my sweet complete desire
Sunny
One so true I love you
Sunny
Yesterday my life
was filled with rain
Sunny
You smiled at me
And really eased the pain
The dark days are gone
And the bright days are here
My Sunny one shines so sincere
Sunny
One so true I love you
I love you
I love you
I love you
I love you
