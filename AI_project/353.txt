Really
I'm guessing you don't have
much experience with heat
Nope But sometimes
I like to close my eyes
and imagine what it'd be like
when summer does come
Bees'll buzz
kids'll blow dandelion fuzz
And I'll be doing whatever
snow does in summer
A drink in my hand
my snow up against
the burning sand
Prob'ly getting gorgeously
tanned in summer
I'll finally see a summer breeze
blow away a winter storm
And find out what happens
to solid water when it gets warm
And I can't wait to see
what my buddies all think of me
Just imagine how much cooler
I'll be in summer
Dah dah da doo
uh bah bah bah bah bah boo
The hot and the cold
are both so intense
Put 'em together it just makes sense
Rrr Raht da daht
dah dah dah dah dah
dah dah dah doo
Winter's a good time
to stay in and cuddle
But put me in summer
and I'll be a happy snowman
When life gets rough
I like to hold on to my dream
Of relaxing in the summer sun
just lettin' off steam
Oh the sky would be blue
and you guys will be there too
When I finally do what
frozen things do in summer
I'm gonna tell him
Don't you dare
In summer
