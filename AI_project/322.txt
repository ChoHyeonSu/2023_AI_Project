All I wanna do
Is get out with you
All I see is lights, baby
When I party with you

(Ooh, I like it) The way you make me feel
Don't wanna get too close to you (ooh, I like it)
Give me all the loving, baby
(I like it, babe, I like it, baby)

Why you wanna play, wanna play around?
Like you don't know what I want from you, uh
Just wanna have a good time, let my hair down
And do everything we wanted to, oh no

We can dance all night 'til the sunrise
Or cruise drop top under moonlight
You know that I'm down to ride
I'm talking Bon and Clyde
Put your money on me, you're bound to win
Yeah, the night is just beginning
But it might end up with your hands on my body

All I wanna do
Is get out with you
All I see is lights, baby
When I party with you

(Ooh, I like it) The way you make me feel
Don't wanna get too close to you (ooh, I like it)
Give me all the loving, baby
(I like it, babe, I like it, baby)

How am I to stay with the games that you play?
How am I supposed to lay in the bed that you made?
If love can be bought, I'm willing to pay the cost
There was times I was down, I was willing to give my all
My heart on my sleeve, I'm willing to take it off
It's me, I leave, whatever, don't work it out
Did the trial, never lie say I'm perfect
Do it all again, swear to God, it was worth it
All I wanna do is get away from here with you
They don't know the things we go through
Tired of talking, let me show you
I mean, please, just let me coach you
We need space, here's where we're going
How the profile keep on blowing
They can't see us and they know it

(Ooh, I like it) The way you make me feel
Don't wanna get too close to you (ooh, I like it)
Give me all the loving, baby
(I like it, babe, I like it, baby)
